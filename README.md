<h1> Insurance Policy System </h1>

<p>The specifcation required the creation of an Insurance Policy Application that would support several specific 'Insurance Policy Types' including 'Motor' (which I would be responsible for), 'Home', 'Travel', 'Medical' etc.</p>

<p>Each 'Insurance Policy' would have shared instance variables and methods with 'Insurance Policy' as well as specific instance variables and methods for their own type.</p>

<p>This OOP solution required the use of inheritance, ENUMs as well as full JUnit testing.</p>

A driver class PolicySearch would also be required to facilite user searches and policy validation - using parameterised methods.
